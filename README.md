# A pragmatic introduction to version control with git and Github

This is a set of two lessons designed to get you using version control as quickly as possible. We might leave off some fundamentals

We have set up an Etherpad for note-taking: <https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/BUStudyGroup-git>

## Tech and materials

You'll need a working installation of git on your computer. If you are using a Mac or Linux, it is possible that you already have git. Open up a terminal and type `which git` and press enter. If you see something that looks like `/usr/bin/git`, then you're all set. If nothing shows up, you'll need to download git. Go to the [git downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and click on the right operating system. If you're using Windows, there is a Windows installer, but you might also want to look into [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io) which provides some other things that will make your experience a little more like Unix users.

You will also want to sign up for an account on [Github](https://github.com) if you do not already have one. There are some additional steps you can take to make your life easier from [Github's help section](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).
